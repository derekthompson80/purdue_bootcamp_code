            <strong>Jane Austen</strong> was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which critique and comment on the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Her works are celebrated for their wit, social observation, and insights into the lives of women. Today, Austen's novels remain widely read and adapted, making her one of the most influential authors in English literature.

            <p>Jane Austen was born in <em>Steventon, Hampshire</em>, the seventh of eight children. She began writing at a young age, creating stories and plays for her family. Her first published novel, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (1811), was followed by <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> (1813), which quickly became popular.</p>
            <p>Austen's life was largely spent in rural England, and her close observation of domestic life shaped the settings and characters of her novels. Although she received modest recognition during her lifetime, her posthumous fame grew significantly in the 19th and 20th centuries.</p>
            <p>She died in 1817 in Winchester. Many of her works were published anonymously, identified only as being written "By a Lady," a reminder of the social constraints on women writers of her era.</p>
